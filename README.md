## **Prerequisites**

it's an *intensive ML in Python course*, so...

- if you have prior knowledge in the field of statistics, it would be good if it was at least an introductory college 
course; we will refresh with you the basics of probability theory and statistics and provide you with materials for your 
review of the basics of those areas to the extent sufficient to follow the course;

- it would not be bad to remind yourself what functions are, what is the maximum and what is the minimum of some functions, 
how to draw their graphs, etc., but for that you will have clear online materials and we will repeat the necessary;

- you should have at least elementary, working knowledge of the Python programming language: flow control, data types, 
classes, understanding what list comprehension is, etc.; again, and we'll have review materials for that, but this course 
shouldn't be your first time seeing the Python programming language.
